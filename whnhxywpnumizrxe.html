well: we can not use a component to indicate the non-rediness of the corresponding level because we need that component to represent the version at that level that is being developed</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>thus: a 0 means a not ready version of what is before it; foo.0 is a development version of foo</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>some examples:</p><div class="wit-content"><section><p>3.2.5.1 is totally ready; though the users will probably meet only the 3 highest level components</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>3.2.5.0 is ready at higher levels but not in quality, fixes are to come</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>3.2.0.is ready at the backward compatibility level but is not ready at the features level [new features are to come]</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>3.0.*.is not ready even at the backward compatibility level</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>0.*.*.- what does this mean though?; here the highest component is 0; nothing is before it; looks like my propagated unifmority is broken; well, it is not broken, we just need to think about it more generally; what is before the highest component of the version?; the name of the product; we can think of the full product name as the base name then the version which is a list of numbers; then any prefix of the full name [or full version] is the name of a set of properties characteristic to the corresponding version branch; the name itself is also a prefix of the full version and it also has some properties that is characteristic to it throughout the whole life of the product, even through the backward compatibility breakages; this set of characteristics constitute the concept of the product; this 0.*.*.is a version from the development phase when not even the concept of the product is clear yet, a development version towards the proof of concept</p><div class="wit-content" /></section></div></section></div></section></div></section></span></body></html>
