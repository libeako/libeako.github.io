should these children have citizenship? most native people would choose to give these children citizenship; some half-immigrant children getting citizenship this way is not considered to be a problem by most native people; but in case of massive immigration this phenomenon gets massive too; once distinct immigrant communities are formed then the reproduction can und usually does continue mostly internally, keeping their foreign culture, remaining isolated; and during this : by the generations passing : the number of citizens among them grows exponentially; just because at least one citizen got into the community and reproduced, injecting the citizenship, which then spreads exponentially; this may result in an immigrant nation forming a nation inside the native nation, with political power, taking over and changing the country; many people do not want this and many are even terrified by the possibility of this; they then incorrectly conclude that the immigration must be not allowed; but the error really is not the immigration, but that the immigrants get citizenship; hence should the immigrants&#39; children not get citizenship, even if one of their parents is a citizen? that is also quite bad; what if the states of both parents deny citizenship for this reason? at least one of them must, but then the question and problem arises : which one? and even if one does : perhaps the family wants to leave in the other country and raise their children accordingly; something is clearly erroneous with this strict citizenship choice too</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>one step towards the solution is to decouple from the citizenship the critical rights coming with it : the right to vote; giving citizenship may remain lenient as now, except the right to vote</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>then should the mixed children not have right to vote?
