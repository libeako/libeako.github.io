it is simple too, but only relatively to its expressive power and safety; but absolutely it is complex, heavy; it is a real programming language; though total, but still a programming language; i can imagine complex configuration tasks where that power is good but many [perhaps the majority of] configuration tasks require only a few simple unrelated properties, expressed as strings;
