even more cleverly, as it can store information about the reason of the failure too; in the case of Maybe it is obvious which case corresponds to success and which case corresponds to failure of computation, as no reason to successfully compute a nothing; but with &#39;Either&#39; it is not obvious, as its cases are mathematically equivalent; to solve this problem it is tempting to change the naming:</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>datatype Result (a : Type) (b : Type) = error a | success b</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>but this is a design mistake, because though the most notable usage of Either&#39;

this is surprising but true; they both are well defined by mathematics, in an exact and very abstract manner; as categories; you can think of categories as directed graphs, with certain properties, which i do not want to present here; product and sum type constructions are defined by graphs that have the same structure with oppositely directed edges; that is the only difference: all the edge directions are opposite; otherwise they have the same structure; with this in mind it is not surprising that we observe dualities between them; here are some:</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>if x is a value of a { product | sum } type t then the members of t list the possible datas that we can { project x down to | build x up to from }</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>the compiler automatically generates { projection | construction } functions from the members of the { product | sum } type</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>the number of values of a { product | sum } type equals the { product | sum } of the numbers of values of the member types;
