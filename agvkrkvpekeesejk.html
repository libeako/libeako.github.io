that is, increasing the general value added tax is a better solution; an even better one is to decrease the tax of employment [if it is applied] at low wage [to avoid forcing the wealth to go through the state [because both taxing and giving away money has extra costs]]</p><div class="wit-content" /></section></div></section><section><p>who benefits from the wage minimum law ?</p><div class="wit-content"><section><p>it is bad for the employees [mostly for them], for the customers and everyone in the society by decreasing the efficiency of the economy;
