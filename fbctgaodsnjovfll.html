It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn&#39;t resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.&quot;</p><div class="wit-content" /></section></div></section><section><p>using an optional type is much better from all perspective</p><div class="wit-content"><section><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type">what is an optional type</a></p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>i may use the name &quot;Maybe&quot; for the optional type constructor function</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>even in programming language that contain null, one should adopt the practise to almost never use it</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>just pretend that the value set of type T does not contain null, and make this a convention</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>when the value is intended to be optional then use Maybe&lt;T&gt;</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>this gives a big readability boost to the code, because the reader can tell whether a value is optional at first glance</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>it makes it totally clear where handling of non-existent case have to happen : when a Maybe&lt;T&gt; is given and a T is needed</p><div class="wit-content"><section><p>at such places</p><div class="wit-content"><section><p>it force the coder to handle the non-existing case; hence null reference exception will not arise in run-time</p><div class="wit-content" /></section></div></section><section><p>at other places</p><div class="wit-content"><section><p>the coder can totally forget about the topic</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>the coder do not place unnecessary (null checks and handlings) &quot;just-in-case&quot;</p><div class="wit-content" /></section></div></section><section><p>the saving of unnecessary handlings of non-existence [boring, repetitive work] improves the quality of the necessary ones</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>with null usage the responsibility to check null is usually unclear, it is inconvenient to store this info in comments and mine it from comments, and those comments usually even do not exist</p><div class="wit-content" /></section></div></section><section><p>using Maybe instead of null is moving the boring work of (tracking the possibility of non-existence) from the human to the compiler</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>and no, one can not do this with unit tests; that would require an un-writable, un-maintainable amount of testing code and would not guarantee correctness</p><div class="wit-content" /></section></div></section></div></section><section><p>enum</p><div class="wit-content"><section><p>the same story here as with null</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>enum values like &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;undefined&quot;, &quot;default&quot; should be moved out of the enum type&#39;s value set, and represented by wrapping the enum type with Maybe</p><div class="wit-content" /></section></div></section></span></body></html>
