the current state of the art is that type systems should be built on a core named &quot;calculus of constructions&quot;, which is very powerful and simple and natural; which is very powerful and simple and natural; programming languages with such type systems unify coding with logic, and by this they bring us the ability to use a simple general purpose programming language not only for software implementation, but also for mathematical modelling, specifying, verifying;
