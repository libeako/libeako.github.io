i could not imagine this and hence i could not understand the doctors opinion about this; they failed to explain to me that psyche can actually cause real sharp strong physical pain; previously i thought that they think that i lie about my pain, that i am a complaining type of person; but i did not have any other type of pain then from joints, only from my joints; also i considered myself psychically stable</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>not getting any info from doctors that i could interpret, i turned to learn rheumatology myself from the internet; i myself realized that there is no rheumatic disease with similar symptoms</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>later i met some doctors who made a better job in explaining to me the psychic induced pain syndrome; that is that they do believe my pain, they just do not think that it is caused by tissue damage</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>in the same time i started to think about my health problem like i work in my own profession, programming : we programmers when investigate a bug often start at where the bug is observed and try to trace the causation graph backwards; the observation of my health bug was the pain; so i became interested in how the pain is formed by the nervous system; i learned that pain is a very complex and delicate system; but such systems easily go wrong; i learned that i do not need to be psychically ill to form physical pain psychically</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>now i think that most people build up such mistaken pain over their years, it is just not so severe in most of the people as it was in me</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>i now speculate that my pain was from some of these causes</p><div class="wit-content"><section><p>our pain system was developed during human evolution, most of which happened in wild circumstances, the pain system did not get used to long lasting health problems [individual animals with long-lasting health problems probably died because of that problem]</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>the pain associated to some tissue injuries are felt only a day later; typically the joint injuries; due to my joints being instable i had many micro injuries in my joints; i interpreted the pain response being delayed so that at the moment of injury the pain is incorrectly too weak; hence my brain sensitized the pain from around my joints</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>my syptoms getting worse made me worried; worry makes the brain concentrate on the senses we get from the problematic body area, that is : sensitize it, increasing the pain; this is a negative spiral</p><div class="wit-content" /></section></div></section><section><p>now it is about half year after my enlightenment; i am getting better; i still am afraid to sit for long time or on hard surface, but i already do not worry while standing or laying in bed; i guess : the pain that i built up during 23 years will not go away suddenly, but it is going away</p><div class="wit-content" /></section><section><p>after yet another half year : i barely think about any pain, but i still am very gentle with my joints, trying to not overload them accidentally</p><div class="wit-content" /></section></span></body></html>
